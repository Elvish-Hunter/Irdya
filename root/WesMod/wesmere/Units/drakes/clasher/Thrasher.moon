    description: _ "Instead of letting themselves be bound by their armor, Thrashers have learned to redirect its weight to supplement their bodiesâ€™ momentum, adding power to the blows of their short spears and hand-mounted claws. Equipment and body are one; even their thick helms and the thick skulls beneath them are weapons. A Thrasher will gladly fulfill his caste duties, as long as it can be done on the battlefield."
