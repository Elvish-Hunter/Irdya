    description: _ "The greatest of thieves are sometimes tasked to take far more than their victimâ€™s belongings. Masters of knife-fighting and uncannily light on their feet, these menacing figures will employ any means to dispatch their victims, be it poisoned knives thrown from afar, or a dagger planted in the back. Deadly at night, assassins are less able fighting under the sun." .. SPECIAL_NOTES .. SPECIAL_NOTES_BACKSTAB .. SPECIAL_NOTES_POISON .. SPECIAL_NOTES_SKIRMISHER
