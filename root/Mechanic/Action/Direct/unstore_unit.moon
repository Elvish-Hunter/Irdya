-- [unstore_unit]
-- Creates a unit from a game variable, and activates it on the playing field. This must be a specific variable describing a unit, and may not be an array -- to unstore an entire array, iterate over it. The variable is not cleared. See also [store_unit], [while] and [clear_variable].
-- @param variable: the name of the variable.
-- @param find_vacant: whether the unit should be placed on the nearest vacant tile to its specified location. If this is set to 'no'(default), then any unit on the same tile as the unit being unstored will be destroyed.
-- @param check_passability: (boolean yes|no, default yes): If yes, checks for terrain passability when placing the unit. This key has no effect if find_vacant=no (no check performed then). Before 1.9 this key is always "no".
-- @param text: (translatable) floating text to display above the unit, such as a damage amount
-- @param male_text, female_text: (Version 1.13.2 and later only) (translatable) gender-specific versions of the above
-- @param red, green, blue: (default=0,0,0) the color to display the text in. Values vary from 0-255. You may find it convenient to use the {COLOR_HARM} or {COLOR_HEAL} macro instead. (Use {COLOR_HARM} or {COLOR_HEAL} instead of the whole red,green,blue= line.)
-- @param advance: (default=true) if true the unit is advanced if it has enough XP. When modifying XP make sure to do it from inside a synchronized event or it may lead to OOS errors especially when several advancement paths exist. Note that advance and post advance events are called, so infinite loops can happen.
-- @param fire_event: (boolean yes|no, default no) Whether any advance/post advance events shall be fired if an advancement takes place, no effect otherwise.
-- @param animate: (boolean yes|no, default yes) Whether "levelout" and "levelin" (or fade to white and back) animations shall be played if an advancement takes place, no effect otherwise.
-- @param x ,y: override unit location, "x,y=recall,recall" will put the unit on the unit's side's recall list.
-- Units can be unstored with negative (or zero) hit points. This can be useful if modifying a unit in its last_breath event (as the unit's death is already the next step), but tends to look wrong in other cases. In particular, it is possible to have units with negative hit points in play. Such units are aberrations, subject to unusual behavior as the game compensates for them. (For example, such units are currently automatically hitâ€“and killedâ€“in combat.) The details of the unusual behavior are subject to change between stable releases without warning.
