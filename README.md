Irdya is a Wesmere (TODO: link to Wesmere) Package aiming to play the Battle for [Wesnoth](http://wesnoth.org).

It is written in [MoonScript](http://moonscript.org) a language derived from [Lua](http://lua.org).

Game Mechanics are mostly coded using the addon api and are meant to be easy to costumize.

The game content (and thus the add-ons) can be written either in Lua or Moonscript.
Every content shipped with Irdya are MoonScripts.

Neither the needed host application nor the display client to run a game are finished yet.

Although Irdya ships with the ported unit test scenario suite of the original Wesnoth project.
